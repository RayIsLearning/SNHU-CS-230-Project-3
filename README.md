Software design document exploring multiple platforms

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?:
I interpreted the wants and needs of the client and executed a software design plan.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?:
Planning the design document helped me implement the "singleton tester" class to my Java code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?:
I would revise the Pom.XML file in my Maven project to improve funstionality.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?:
I carefully interpreted the desires of the client. Service to the customer is extremely important as it reflects the quality of my work and helps me maintian 
future relationships with the client and will help grow business prospects.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?:
I approcahed the design document with a release to multiple platforms in mind. This was challenging due to my infamiliarity with some of the platforms that 
were requested. I turned that into an enriching learning opportunity by developing software solutions that are compatible with the requested platforms.
